**Please report problems with this plugin on the [DialogOS issue tracker](https://github.com/dialogos-project/dialogos/issues)**
- STILL WORK in PROGRESS -
This repository contains a not yet finished DialogOS ASR-Plugin using Google's Speech-To-Text API (https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text). This could improve the Speech Recognition Results of DialogOS, so that more Language can be recognized correctly. 

## Usage:
You need to have a Google Cloud account and enable speech recognition for this account.
See further instructions on https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/quickstart-client-libraries .

Please download the JSON credentials file via the Cloud Console and run
`export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/credentials.json`, of course 
substituting the path to the credentials so that they can be found.
